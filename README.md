# Dynamistics

You may have come across situations where gazing at tooltips is too abstract, and doesn't provide enough information. Surely it would be convenient if there was a clearer way to see the ins and outs of certain items? This is a client-side mod that should help with such troubling matters.

This mod adds recipes to Just Enough Items that will show you:

- Exactly how your Applied Energistics 2 Patterns are encoded.
- What's in your PackagedAuto Recipe Packages.
- What recipes your PackagedAuto Recipes were encoded to perform.

Works even in the absence of any of the other mods, and works with AE2 and PackagedAuto's own JEI integration.
